Modified Handbrake build to replace SVT-AV1 with SVT-AV1-PSY
You can simply run patch.sh on linux to get the patched version of the HandBrake repository and afterwards you can build it using the commands on the HandBrake wiki.
I've copied and modified the GitHub Actions to generate executables for every platform. It works on linux, but more patches are needed. Help for testing on other platforms would be helpful, thanks.
